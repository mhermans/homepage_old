abstract = "University organizations are unique in Belgium in having a dual-channel structure for employee voice, consisting of both a trade union-based channel and a collegial channel with co-management rights. Universities have also experienced in the last two decades a shift in their position relative to the State and the market. This has resulted in both a growing “flexible layer” in the composition of university personnel, as well as a (relative) decrease in employee voice within the university organization. When taking into account the currently visible issues in both employee voice channels, it appears that the dual-channel structure is not sufficiently sensitive to deal with this double evolution. This insensitivity is compounded by the tendency to discuss university governance in terms of “collegial governance”, with little attention to existing and growing inequalities in employee voice within and between universities."
